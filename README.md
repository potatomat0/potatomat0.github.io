Personal blog of Nhat Kappa Hoang, hosted on GitHub and created with **[Jekyll CMS](https://jekyllrb.com/)**.

The current theme is licensed under the MIT license and was created by **riggaz**. The theme can be found at https://github.com/riggraz/no-style-please.

I mainly write about music and older translation work from my high school years, but I also write about movies, random thoughts, and anything else that comes to mind.

I have no intention of making this blog a place to share my web development experience. I find those things to be boring, and I'm sure you do too.

I'll be sharing my random thoughts and observations on the world around me. I'm not sure what to expect from these posts, but I'm sure they'll be entertaining at the very least.
